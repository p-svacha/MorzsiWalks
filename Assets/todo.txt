Features:
- Ã¶v routes (gestrichelt, higher/custom? length, can be turned on/off in route gen)
- Nodes can be marked as picknick spots
	- route gen has additional checkmark "include pickick?"
	- paths to/from picknick-spots can be walked twice instead of once (not same direction)
- Add "areas" that paths can be added/removed from
	- can exclude areas from route generation (i.e. schwarzwark after 19:00)
- Add "via" possibility to include a specific path or node in route gen.
- Add future value approximation with graph that shows all possible path priorities for the next x metres and then makes it into one average value.
	- make sure only valid paths are considered (no turning arounde etc.)
	- generalize some cangothere functions with routes as input
- make it possible to click on paths when simulating route

UI:
Add parameters to route generation
